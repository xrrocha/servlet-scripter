### Servlet Scripter Notes

- POC: remote scripting for spring-boot application administration on linux servers via ssh
- bash and other shells qualify as script languages, beyond jsr-223
- Powershell is also available on Linux
- jsr-223 services can be provided that mimic Powershell's ability to deal with (system) object
- The ability to _compose_ services and scripts is very useful. In particular, it should be possible to call any (accessible) script or service (probably without the need to explicitly state a dependency?)
- [Ammonite Ops](http://ammonite.io/#Ammonite-Ops) and [Ammonite Shell](http://ammonite.io/#Ammonite-Shell) scripting define another useful script language/type
